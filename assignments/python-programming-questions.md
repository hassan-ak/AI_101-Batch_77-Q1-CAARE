---

### Question 12. Grade Calculator

- Create a program that calculates a student's final grade based on multiple components.
  - Input: List of assignment scores [85, 92, 78, 96, 88] and their weights [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]
  - Calculate the weighted average
  - Determine the letter grade (A: 90+, B: 80-89, C: 70-79, D: 60-69, F: <60)
  - Print the scores, weights, weighted average, and letter grade

---

### Question 13. Password Strength Checker

- Write a program that checks the strength of a password based on various criteria.
  - Check if password has at least 8 characters
  - Check if it contains uppercase letters
  - Check if it contains lowercase letters
  - Check if it contains numbers
  - Check if it contains special characters
  - Print the original password and a strength rating (Weak/Medium/Strong)
  - Test with two passwords: one weak and one strong

---

### Question 14. Word Frequency Counter

- Given a sentence, count the frequency of each word and display the results.
  - Input: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
  - Convert to lowercase and remove punctuation
  - Count each word's frequency
  - Print the original sentence and word frequency dictionary

---

- Create two 3x3 matrices and perform basic operations.
  - Matrix A: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
  - Matrix B: [[9, 8, 7], [6, 5, 4], [3, 2, 1]]
  - Print both matrices
  - Add the matrices element-wise
  - Print the result
