## Part A ‚Äì Basic String Handling

1. Store your name in a variable. Print it in:

   - lowercase
   - uppercase
   - title case

2. Write a program that prints a personalized message:

   - Example output: `Hello Ayesha, would you like to learn Python today?`

3. Store a sentence in a variable. Print it with:

   - a tab before it (`\t`)
   - a newline before it (`\n`)

---

## Part B ‚Äì Whitespace and Cleaning

4. Save a name with extra spaces (before and after). Show the results of:

   - `rstrip()`
   - `lstrip()`
   - `strip()`

5. Save the string `"  Python Crash Course  "` in a variable and remove all whitespace before printing it cleanly.

## Part C ‚Äì String Combination

6. Store a first name and last name in two variables. Join them into one string and print it in a sentence.

7. Store your favorite quote and author in two variables. Print them like this:

   ```
   Einstein once said, "A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new."
   ```

## Part D ‚Äì String Methods

8. Write a program that takes `"PYTHON is fun!"` and prints:

   - all lowercase
   - all uppercase
   - in title case

9. Save a filename like `"notes.txt"`. Print it without the `.txt` extension using `.removesuffix()`.

10. Store the string `"www.example.com"`. Use `.removeprefix("www.")` to print only `"example.com"`.

---

## Part E ‚Äì Error Practice

11. Write a string with a missing quotation mark (to see the syntax error). Then fix it.

12. Try printing a variable that was never defined (to see the `NameError`). Then correct it by defining the variable.

## üåü Bonus Challenge Section (Optional)

13. Write a program that asks the user for their favorite programming language and prints it in all **3 cases**: lowercase, uppercase, and title case.

14. Write a program that takes a **full name** input and prints:

- First name only
- Last name only
- Initials (like `J.T.`)

15. Write a program that stores a messy sentence with random spaces and prints a **cleaned version**.

- Input: `"   Python   is   awesome!   "`
- Output: `"Python is awesome!"`

16. Create a program that hides part of an email address for privacy.

- Input: `"zaib123@example.com"`
- Output: `"za***@example.com"`

17. Take a string and print it in a **box format** using `*`.

- Input: `"Hello"`
- Output:

  ```
  ******
  *Hello*
  ******
  ```
